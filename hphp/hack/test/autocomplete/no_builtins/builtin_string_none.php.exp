noreturn
  INSERT noreturn
  builtin
SORT TEXT: none
  A `noreturn` function always errors or loops forever.
arraykey
  INSERT arraykey
  builtin
SORT TEXT: none
  An `int` or a `string`. `arraykey` is a common key type for `dict`s.
num
  INSERT num
  builtin
SORT TEXT: none
  An `int` or a `float`.
resource
  INSERT resource
  builtin
SORT TEXT: none
  An external resource, such as a file handle or database connection.
string
  INSERT string
  builtin
SORT TEXT: none
  A sequence of characters.
float
  INSERT float
  builtin
SORT TEXT: none
  A 64-bit floating-point number.
bool
  INSERT bool
  builtin
SORT TEXT: none
  A boolean value, `true` or `false`.
int
  INSERT int
  builtin
SORT TEXT: none
  A 64-bit integer.
void
  INSERT void
  builtin
SORT TEXT: none
  A `void` return type indicates a function that never returns a value. `void` functions usually have side effects.
null
  INSERT null
  builtin
SORT TEXT: none
  The value `null`. The opposite of `nonnull`.
shape
  INSERT shape
  builtin
SORT TEXT: none
  A shape is a key-value data structure where the keys are known. Shapes are value types, just like `dict` and `vec`.
  
   A closed shape, such as `shape('x' => int)`, has a fixed number of keys.  An open shape, such as `shape('x' => int, ...)`, may have additional keys.
nonnull
  INSERT nonnull
  builtin
SORT TEXT: none
  Any value except `null`.
nothing
  INSERT nothing
  builtin
SORT TEXT: none
  The `nothing` type has no values, it's the empty type.
  
  A function returning `nothing` either loops forever or throws an exception. A `vec<nothing>` is always empty.
dynamic
  INSERT dynamic
  builtin
SORT TEXT: none
  Any value at all. Unlike `mixed`, the type checker allows any operation on a `dynamic` value, even if e.g. a method doesn't actually exist.
  
  All operations on a `dynamic` value return another `dynamic` value. Prefer more specific types so the type checker can help you.
  
  To convert a `generic` value to something specific, use `$foo as SomeSpecificType`. This will check the type at runtime and the type checker will verify types after this point.
mixed
  INSERT mixed
  builtin
SORT TEXT: none
  Any value at all. It's usually better to use a more specific type, or a generic.
StringBuilder
  INSERT StringBuilder
  class
SORT TEXT: none
